This module aims to provide a simple way to manage a Senseo Coffee machine through a Raspberry Pi's GPIO and a REST API.

The possible use case is to plug the Senseo machine to a Raspberry Pi Âµ-computer by using its GPIO and to
remotely use the REST API to start/stop the machine, and, to start a coffee production.

> **Note:** This setup is mainly for **fun** usage as it does not manage the water or coffee dose filling.
